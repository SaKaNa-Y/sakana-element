# zpix Pixel Font

This directory should contain the zpix pixel font files for the Sakana-Element pixel-style UI.

## Download Instructions

1. Visit the zpix-pixel-font repository:
   https://github.com/SolidZORO/zpix-pixel-font

2. Download the following font files:
   - `zpix.woff2` (recommended for modern browsers)
   - `zpix.woff` (fallback for older browsers)

3. Place the downloaded files in this directory (`packages/theme/fonts/`)

## Font Files Needed

- `zpix.woff2` - WOFF2 format (best compression, modern browsers)
- `zpix.woff` - WOFF format (fallback)

## Alternative: Use CDN (Not Recommended for Production)

If you want to test quickly without downloading fonts, you could reference them from a CDN by modifying `zpix.css`, but this is not recommended for production use.

## License

zpix is an open-source pixel font. Please check the original repository for license information before use in production.
